# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler API is a Go-based backend service for a receipt management and splitting application. It provides OCR-powered receipt scanning, AI-assisted data extraction, email integration, and multi-user support with group management capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `go build` - Build the application
- `go run main.go` - Run the application directly
- `./set-up-dependencies.sh` - Install system dependencies (tesseract, ImageMagick, Python deps)

### Testing
- `go test -v ./...` - Run all Go tests with verbose output
- `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic -v ./...` - Run tests with coverage
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s ./imap-client` - Run Python IMAP client tests

### API Client Generation
- `./generate-client.sh desktop <output-dir>` - Generate TypeScript Angular client
- `./generate-client.sh mobile <output-dir>` - Generate Dart Dio client

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **main.go** - Application entry point, initializes logging, config, database, and starts HTTP server
- **internal/** - Core application code organized by domain
- **imap-client/** - Python-based email processing client

### Key Directories
- **internal/handlers/** - HTTP request handlers for each API endpoint
- **internal/repositories/** - Database access layer using GORM
- **internal/services/** - Business logic layer
- **internal/models/** - Database models and domain objects
- **internal/commands/** - Command objects for API requests/responses
- **internal/routers/** - Route definitions and middleware setup
- **internal/wranglerasynq/** - Background job processing using Asynq
- **internal/ai/** - AI client implementations (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama)

### Database
- Uses GORM ORM with support for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
- Migrations are handled automatically on startup via `repositories.MakeMigrations()`
- Test databases are set up in `repositories/main_test.go`

### Background Processing
- Uses Hibiken's Asynq library for background job processing
- Email processing, OCR, and cleanup tasks run as background jobs
- Queue configurations defined in `internal/wranglerasynq/`

### AI Integration
- Supports multiple AI providers: OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama
- AI clients implement a common interface defined in `internal/ai/base_client.go`
- Used for receipt data extraction and processing

### Configuration
- Configuration loaded from JSON files in `config/` directory
- Environment variables override config file settings
- Sample configuration in `config/config.sample.json`

## Testing Patterns

Each package typically has:
- `main_test.go` - Test setup and teardown
- `*_test.go` - Unit tests for specific functionality
- Test utilities in `internal/utils/testing.go` and `internal/repositories/testing.go`

Tests use dependency injection patterns and mock implementations for external services.

## Testing Guidelines for Claude

When working with tests in this codebase, follow these critical requirements:

### Test Execution Requirements
- **ALWAYS run tests after writing them** - When asked to write tests, you MUST run them to verify they pass
- **Report coverage** - Always report the coverage of files impacted by the tests using `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic`
- **Verify all tests pass** - Never consider test writing complete until all tests are verified to pass

### Test Database Cleanup
- **Failed tests may leave behind `app.db` files** in test directories (e.g., `services/app.db`, `handlers/app.db`)
- **These MUST be removed** before rerunning tests to avoid conflicts
- **CRITICAL**: Only remove `app.db` files from test directories, NEVER delete anything from the `sqlite/` directory
- Example cleanup locations: `internal/services/app.db`, `internal/handlers/app.db`, etc.

### Test Workflow
1. Write tests following existing patterns in the codebase
2. Run tests to verify they pass: `go test -v ./...`
3. Generate and report coverage: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic -v ./...`
4. If tests fail, check for and remove any `app.db` files in test directories
5. Re-run tests until all pass
6. Report final coverage results for impacted files

## OCR and Image Processing

- Tesseract OCR integration via `otiai10/gosseract`
- ImageMagick integration for image processing and format conversion
- Supports HEIC format conversion to standard image formats
- Python dependencies for additional image processing capabilities

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI 3.1 specification in `swagger.yml`
- API serves on port 8081 by default
- All endpoints require JWT authentication except login/signup
